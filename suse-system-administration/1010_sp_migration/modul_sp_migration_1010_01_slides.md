    * Network installation source:

        * SCC

        * SMT

        * SUSE Manager

        * Installation Source Server

*  graphical and a command line tool

## Preparations

* Backing up data

* Temporarily disable kernel multiversion support

* MySQL / PostgreSQL Database

## Disk Space

* Space requirements depend on your particular partitioning profile and the software selected.

* During the update procedure, YaST will check the free disk space and display a warning to the user if the installation may exceed the available amount.

## Checking Disk Space

Non-Btrfs File Systems

```text
df -h
```

Btrfs Root File Systems

```text
btrfs filesystem df /

df -h /
```

## Supported Upgrade Paths

* Cross-architecture upgrades are not supported.

* SLES 10: There is no supported direct migration path to SLES 12. A fresh installation is recommended instead.

* SLES 11 GA, SP1 or SP2: There is no supported direct migration path to SLES 12. (GA -> SP1 -> SP2 -> SP3)

## Supported Upgrade Paths
