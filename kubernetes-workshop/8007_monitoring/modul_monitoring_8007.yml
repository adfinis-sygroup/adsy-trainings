Description: >
    We explain approaches to monitoring Kubernetes and the applications running
    on top of it. The focus of this module is on Prometheus, as the de-facto
    standard for Kubernets. We show how metrics need to be presented by
    applications to be automatically ingested by Prometheus and how one can
    query the data using the Prometheus query language.
