# What is Kubernetes?

Container Orchestration Solution

Automates the deployment and management of containers

# Why Kubernetes?

* Fastest growing community
* One of the top GitHub projects
* Aggregates Googles knowledge of the past years
* Better design decisions and implementations than competitors

**Move fast and ~~break things~~!**

# Why container orchestration?

* Managing applications is hard
* Packaging applications is even harder
* Deploying applications is cumbersome

**Automation is key!**

---

## What does Kubernetes offer?

* Pods based on immutable Docker images
* Deployments managing application updates
* Persistent Storage
* DNS Resolution for Services
* Secret Management
* Config Management

**All of this via a "simple" REST API!**

## What is k8s handling for us?

* Scheduling ✔
* Networking ✔
* Storage ✔
* Rolling Update ✔
* Autoscaling ✔

# Kubernetes Terminology

## Pods and Container

Pod is the smallest unit in Kubernetes

* Pod can consist of multiple containers
* All containers of a pod run on the same node
* Containers in a pod can communicate via localhost
* Containers in a pod share a kernel namespace

## Service

Services abstract access to Pods

* Selection of Pods via Labels
* Typically only cluster internal access

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: "example-service-prod"
spec:
  selector:
    app: "example-app"
    env: "production"
  ports:
    - protocol: "TCP"
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

## Ingressᵝ

Ingress allows external access to Services

* Hostname
* URL
* HTTPS possible
* TCP/UDP support in the future

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: "echo-ingress"
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: "echoheaders"
    servicePort: 80
  tls:
    - hosts:
      - "echo.example.com"
      secretName: "echo-tls"
```

## Deployment

Manages a set of Pods

* De facto standard for deploying applications
* Manages multiple iterations of an application
* Creates a ReplicaSets for each release
* Allows rollback to a previous release when desired

## Persistent Volume Claim

Requests for persistent Storage

* Automatic provisioning in Azure Cloud
* Different requirements via StorageClass

## Namespace

Separation of consumers/environments

* Ressource Quotas
* All resources are attached to a namespace
* RBAC makes sharing of namespaces possible

# Common CLI commands

---

## kubectl

* CLI for **everything**
* Short for kube control
* [Some](https://twitter.com/search?q=kube-cuddle) believe it is pronounced kube-~~cuddle~~cuttle

## kubectl create

Create resources in Kubernetes

* Definition in YAML or JSON
* Validation in `kubectl` client

```bash
kubectl create -f pod.yaml
kubectl create -f http://example.com/pod.yaml
cat pod.yaml | kubectl create -f -
kubectl create -R -f dir/
```

## kubectl get

List Kubernetes resources

* Different output formats
* Filtering via labels possible

```bash
kubectl get all
kubectl get pods
kubectl get dc
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get all -l env=production
kubectl get po/nodejs-ex -o yaml
```

## kubectl edit

Edit resource definitions

* Validation in `kubectl` client
* Suitable for debugging

```bash
kubectl edit dc/nodejs-ex
```

## kubectl delete

Deletion of resources

```bash
kubectl delete rc/nodejs-ex
```
